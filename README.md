## Features

### Syntax hightlight

## Requirements
vscode (>1.30).

## Known Issues
Currently do not detect normal variable.

### Select MATLAB as a language
* On the bottom-right corner, click on the *select language mode* button, if you have created a new file it should display *Plain Text*
* Select *S-Lang* in the list of languages.

Alternatively, saving the file with a `.m` extension, will allow VS Code to understand that it is a MATLAB file, and automatically select the language correctly.
